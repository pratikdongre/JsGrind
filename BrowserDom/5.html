<!-- basic dom node properties 
 Node properites: type tag and contents 

 Dom node classes 
 different dom nodes may have different properties
 for example element node of tag a may has link related propes
 input tage has input related props 

 text nodes are not same as element nodes 
 some common props they may have 
 because everythign comes from one single hierarchy
 
 
 each dom node belongs to corresponding built in class

 the root is eventTarget that is inherited by node 
 and the other dom nodes inherit from it 

so event target is the root abstract class that provides the support for events 
objects of this class are never created 
it serves as a base for all the dom nodes 

node also an absract class serving as the base for dom nodes 
it provides the core tree functionality 
parentNOde, childNode,nextSiblin (they are getters )
objects of htis class are nevere created 
but other classes inherit from it 


document  inherited by HTMLDOcument
the document global object belongs exactly to this class 
it serves as an entry point to the dom 

character data an abstract  class inherited by 
text the class corressponding to  the text inside elements 
eg like hello in <p>Hello</p>
comment the class for comments 
element is the base class for dom elements 

it provides element level navigation like 
children,nextElementSibling,
and seraching methods like 
getElementbyTagName, queryselector

element serves as a base for many classes 
such as HTMLElement

HTMLelement is the basic class for all html elements
it is inheritated by concrete html elemnts 
like 
HTMLinputElement the class of input element
HTMLbodyElement the class of <body> element
HTMLanchorElement the class of <a> elements 
    
there are many tags with their own classes that may have speicific propersties and methods
while some such as span, section article do not have any particualre properties 
so thery are instance of HTMLElemtns 


So, the full set of properties and methods of a given node comes as the result of the chain of inheritance.

For example, let’s consider the DOM object for an <input> element. It belongs to HTMLInputElement class.

It gets properties and methods as a superposition of (listed in inheritance order):

HTMLInputElement – this class provides input-specific properties,
HTMLElement – it provides common HTML element methods (and getters/setters),
Element – provides generic element methods,
Node – provides common DOM node properties,
EventTarget – gives the support for events (to be covered),
…and finally it inherits from Object, so “plain object” methods like hasOwnProperty are also available.


to see the dom node class name
as the we can recall object has the constructor propertyes which referencet the class constructor
and constructor.name is its name

            // can also do 
            console.dir(document.body);
