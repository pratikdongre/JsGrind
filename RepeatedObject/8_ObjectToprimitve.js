// what happens when objects are added obj1 + obj2 , subtracted obj1 - obj2 or printed using alert(obj)
// in case of such operations objects are auto converted to primtives and then the operation is carreid out over theses primitives and results in primtive value 
/*
the result of an obj1 + obj2 cant be result into another object 

object to primitve 
there are two purposes 
1. it will allow us to understand whats going on in case of coding mistakes when such operation happens accidentally
2. there are exceptions where such operation are possible and look good eg subtraction or comparing dates
